Detailed Meaning of Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property

Understanding the core components—Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property—is essential for creating clear and consistent Business Data Elements (BDEs). Each component provides a specific context that contributes to the overall meaning of the BDE.

1. Data Object

Definition

The Data Object is the primary business entity or subject the BDE describes. It defines what the data represents and serves as the anchor for all other components of the BDE.

Characteristics
	•	Represents a real-world business concept: Data Objects typically reflect key entities in the business domain, such as customers, invoices, accounts, or employees.
	•	Must be unambiguous: The Data Object should align with standard terminology defined in the organization’s business glossary or external frameworks like FIBO.
	•	Used consistently across domains: A common Data Object name ensures alignment and reusability across functional areas.

Examples

Data Object	Description
customer	A person or organization engaged in business transactions with the company.
invoice	A document issued by the company requesting payment for goods or services.
account	A financial entity representing a ledger for transactions or balances.
transaction	A business activity involving the transfer of goods, services, or funds.

2. Scope

Definition

The Scope specifies the context, domain, or boundary in which the data is applicable. It provides additional details about where or how broadly the Data Object is relevant.

Characteristics
	•	Defines the coverage or applicability: Can specify geographical regions, business domains, organizational levels, or timeframes.
	•	Ensures granularity: Scope helps differentiate similar data by clarifying its domain or purpose.
	•	Is optional in some cases: If the data is universally applicable (e.g., global scope), the Scope may be omitted.

Examples

Scope	Description
global	Data applicable across all regions or the entire organization.
regional	Data specific to a particular geographical region.
finance	Data relevant to financial operations or reporting.
departmental	Data specific to a department or functional unit within the organization.
monthly	Data limited to a specific month or time period.

3. Status

Definition

The Status refers to the state, condition, or lifecycle phase of the data. It provides additional context about when or in what state the data is valid or applicable.

Characteristics
	•	Defines the temporal or lifecycle state: Clarifies whether the data is pending, approved, current, or historical.
	•	Provides insights into workflow or processing: Status is crucial for understanding the readiness or completeness of the data.
	•	Enables differentiation: Similar data objects with different statuses are treated as distinct BDEs.

Examples

Status	Description
current	Data that is presently valid or applicable.
pending	Data awaiting approval or processing.
approved	Data that has been reviewed and authorized for use.
draft	Data that is in an initial or incomplete state.
historical	Data that refers to past events or conditions.

4. Property

Definition

The Property describes the specific characteristic or attribute of the Data Object. It defines what aspect of the Data Object is being measured, recorded, or analyzed.

Characteristics
	•	Represents a measurable or descriptive aspect: Examples include amounts, dates, names, or balances.
	•	Defines the granularity of the data: The Property provides the specific detail being captured or analyzed.
	•	Aligns with domain-specific terminology: Use consistent terms based on internal or industry standards like ISO 11179 or DCAM.

Examples

Property	Description
amount	The numerical value associated with a financial transaction or balance.
name	The descriptive label or identifier for an entity (e.g., customer, product).
balance	The remaining amount available in an account.
revenue	The total income generated from business activities.
performance score	A metric used to evaluate or measure performance.

Putting It All Together

When combined, Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property create a fully descriptive BDE name that provides comprehensive context. The structured naming convention ensures clarity and consistency while enabling automated processes like tagging and lineage tracking.

Example Table

Data Object	Scope	Status	Property	BDE Name
customer	regional	current	outstanding balance	customer regional current outstanding balance
invoice	global	approved	amount	invoice global approved amount
employee	departmental	pending	leave balance	employee departmental pending leave balance
account	quarterly	current	balance	account quarterly current balance

Conclusion

The components of Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property form the backbone of a robust naming convention for Business Data Elements (BDEs). By clearly defining each component and adhering to industry standards like FIBO, DAMA DMBOK, ISO 11179, and DCAM, organizations can create meaningful, consistent, and scalable BDE names that enhance data governance and usability.
