Guidelines for Defining Business Data Elements (BDEs)

Introduction

A well-structured definition is essential for understanding, managing, and using Business Data Elements (BDEs) effectively. Definitions must be concise, precise, and business-friendly, ensuring they clearly communicate the purpose and meaning of the BDE. This document provides guidelines for crafting high-quality definitions for BDEs, aligned with industry standards such as ISO/IEC 11179, DAMA DMBOK, and DCAM.

Principles of BDE Definitions
	1.	Business-Focused: Definitions should be written in plain, non-technical language to ensure they are understandable by business users as well as technical stakeholders.
	2.	Concise but Comprehensive: Keep definitions brief while ensuring all necessary context is included.
	3.	Consistent: Follow a standard structure for all definitions to maintain uniformity.
	4.	Purpose-Driven: Clearly explain why the BDE exists and how it is used in business processes.
	5.	No Redundancy: Avoid repeating information already conveyed by the BDE name.

Definition Structure

The recommended structure for a BDE definition is:
<Data Object> is the <Property> applicable to <Scope> in <Status>, used for <Purpose>.

Optional Components
	•	Source: Specify where the data originates or is stored.
	•	Constraints: Include any specific rules, ranges, or values applicable to the BDE.
	•	Usage: Detail how the BDE is utilized in business processes or systems.

Definition Guidelines

1. Start with the Data Object

The definition should begin with the Data Object, which is the primary entity being described.

Example:
	•	“Customer is…”
	•	“Invoice is…”

2. Describe the Property

Clearly specify the Property or characteristic of the Data Object being measured or captured.

Examples:
	•	”…the outstanding balance…”
	•	”…the approved amount…”

3. Add Scope

If applicable, include the Scope to contextualize the BDE’s relevance, such as geographical boundaries, organizational domains, or timeframes.

Examples:
	•	”…applicable to regional operations…”
	•	”…specific to quarterly reporting…”

4. Mention Status

Indicate the Status of the BDE to clarify its state within the data lifecycle.

Examples:
	•	”…in its current state…”
	•	”…pending approval…”

5. Explain the Purpose

End the definition with a clear explanation of why the data is captured and how it is used in business processes.

Examples:
	•	”…used for financial reporting and reconciliation.”
	•	”…utilized in employee leave tracking and compliance reporting.”

Examples of BDE Definitions

Simple Example
	•	BDE Name: invoice global approved amount
Definition:
Invoice is the approved monetary amount applicable globally, used for financial reconciliation and reporting.

Detailed Example
	•	BDE Name: customer regional current outstanding balance
Definition:
Customer is the outstanding monetary balance applicable to regional operations in its current state, used for collections and credit risk analysis.
	•	Source: Accounts Receivable System.
	•	Constraints: Must be a positive numeric value.

Best Practices
	1.	Use Consistent Language:
Use uniform phrasing across definitions. For example, always refer to monetary amounts as “monetary value” or “amount.”
	2.	Be Objective:
Avoid subjective or vague language. Clearly define what the BDE represents and how it is used.
	3.	Avoid Jargon:
Use terms that are easily understood by business stakeholders. If technical terms are necessary, provide explanations.
	4.	Align with Standards:
Definitions should reflect industry best practices, such as those outlined in ISO/IEC 11179 and DAMA DMBOK.
	5.	Validate with Stakeholders:
Ensure definitions are reviewed and validated by both business and technical teams to confirm accuracy and usability.

Common Pitfalls to Avoid
	1.	Ambiguity:
Avoid unclear phrases like “can be used for multiple purposes.” Be specific about the purpose and usage.
	2.	Overloading the Definition:
Avoid adding unnecessary details or metadata into the definition. For example, don’t include temporal information like years in the definition unless explicitly required.
	3.	Repeating the Name:
Don’t restate the BDE name in the definition unnecessarily. For example, instead of “Invoice is the invoice amount…,” say “Invoice is the monetary amount…”

Conclusion

A well-crafted definition enhances the usability and governance of Business Data Elements (BDEs). By following these guidelines and using a structured approach, organizations can ensure BDE definitions are consistent, business-friendly, and aligned with global standards. High-quality definitions improve collaboration, enable automated processes, and ensure data clarity across the enterprise.
