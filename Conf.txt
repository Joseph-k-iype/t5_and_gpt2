Here is the updated and refined white paper with a table structure containing five columns—Data Object, Scope, Status, Property, and BDE Name. The BDE names are in small case (except for industry-accepted abbreviations). Additionally, references to relevant standards like FIBO, ISO, DCAM, and DAMA are embedded where applicable to maintain professionalism and credibility.

Comprehensive Guidelines for Naming and Defining Business Data Elements (BDEs)

Abstract

In modern data governance, clear and consistent naming of Business Data Elements (BDEs) is essential for discoverability, lineage tracking, and automation. This document presents a structured approach to naming and defining BDEs using data object, scope, status, and property, ensuring alignment with industry standards such as FIBO, ISO/IEC 11179, DAMA DMBOK, and DCAM. The guidelines emphasize using small case BDE names with industry-accepted abbreviations, ensuring clarity, usability, and scalability.

Introduction

Business Data Elements (BDEs) are the foundational units of data governance that describe specific business concepts or entities. Proper naming conventions for BDEs improve understanding, enable automated tagging, and align with organizational and industry practices. This white paper introduces a detailed framework for naming BDEs based on data object, scope, status, and property, with examples modeled into structured tables. These conventions adhere to global best practices, ensuring a consistent, business-friendly approach.

Core Naming Guidelines

Components of a BDE Name

A BDE name is structured as:
<data object> <scope> <status> <property>

Component	Description	Examples	Relevant Standards
Data Object	The main entity or subject the data refers to.	customer, invoice, employee	FIBO (Entity Identification), ISO 11179 (Metadata Registry Naming Principles)
Scope	The functional, organizational, or geographical boundary where the data applies.	global, regional, finance	FIBO (Domain Context), DAMA DMBOK (Data Domains and Boundaries)
Status	The state or lifecycle phase of the data.	pending, approved, current	DCAM (Lifecycle Management), DAMA DMBOK (Data Lifecycle), ISO 11179 (State Definitions)
Property	The specific attribute or characteristic of the data object.	amount, name, balance	DCAM (Data Concept Definitions), DAMA DMBOK (Data Quality and Definitions)

Naming Rules
	1.	Use Small Case:
	•	BDE names must be written in small case.
	•	Industry-accepted abbreviations (e.g., USD, VAT, ESG) should be capitalized.
	•	Example: customer regional approved amount.
	2.	Be Descriptive and Business-Friendly:
	•	Ensure names are intuitive for non-technical users.
	•	Avoid technical jargon or acronyms unless widely recognized (e.g., VAT).
	•	Example: Use employee pending leave balance instead of emp_lv_bal.
	3.	Maintain Consistency Across Domains:
	•	Use consistent terms for similar concepts across different domains.
	•	Example: Always use customer instead of alternating with client.
	4.	No Special Characters:
	•	Do not include underscores, hyphens, or special symbols. Use spaces to separate words.
	•	Example: invoice approved amount.
	5.	Align with Standards:
	•	Follow recognized naming principles from standards like FIBO, ISO 11179, and DAMA DMBOK.
	•	Reference: ISO/IEC 11179-5:2015.

Examples of BDE Naming

Simple Scenarios

Data Object	Scope	Status	Property	BDE Name
invoice	global	approved	amount	invoice global approved amount
customer	regional	current	annual revenue	customer regional current annual revenue
employee	global	pending	leave balance	employee global pending leave balance
account	quarterly	current	balance	account quarterly current balance

Complex Scenarios

Data Object	Scope	Status	Property	BDE Name
customer	regional	current	outstanding balance	customer regional current outstanding balance
account	monthly	approved	transaction count	account monthly approved transaction count
employee	departmental	current	annual salary	employee departmental current annual salary
sales territory	global	finalized	performance score	sales territory global finalized performance score
product	global	draft	forecast revenue	product global draft forecast revenue
financial transaction	regional	confirmed	settlement date	financial transaction regional confirmed settlement date
parent account	global	current	aggregated balance	parent account global current aggregated balance
child account	regional	pending	specific balance	child account regional pending specific balance

Definition Guidelines for BDEs

Structured Definition Format

A well-structured definition includes:
	1.	Data Object: The main entity being described (e.g., invoice, customer).
	2.	Scope: The functional or geographical context.
	3.	Status: The state or lifecycle of the data.
	4.	Property: The specific attribute of the data object.
	5.	Purpose: The intended business purpose.

Definition Examples

BDE Name	Definition
invoice global approved amount	The total monetary value of globally approved invoices, used for financial reconciliation and reporting.
customer regional current annual revenue	The annual revenue currently attributed to regional customers, used for profitability analysis and strategic planning.
employee global pending leave balance	The total pending leave days globally allocated to employees, used for payroll and compliance reporting.
account quarterly current balance	The account balance applicable at the end of the current quarter, used for reconciliation and financial audits.

Alignment with Industry Standards

Relevant Standards
	•	ISO/IEC 11179: Establishes principles for naming and defining data elements for clarity and consistency.
	•	Reference: ISO/IEC 11179-5:2015
	•	DAMA-DMBOK: Offers a comprehensive framework for data management practices, including naming conventions.
	•	Reference: DAMA DMBOK
	•	FIBO: Provides standardized terms for financial industry data, promoting common understanding.
	•	Reference: FIBO
	•	DCAM: Emphasizes the importance of standardized data definitions and lifecycle management.
	•	Reference: DCAM

Conclusion

A consistent and structured approach to naming Business Data Elements (BDEs) enhances data clarity, interoperability, and governance. By adhering to this framework, which integrates data object, scope, status, and property, organizations can align with global standards and achieve operational excellence. The emphasis on small case naming and clear definitions ensures ease of use for business and technical stakeholders alike.

This white paper provides a professional and business-friendly foundation for naming and defining BDEs, with practical examples and references to standards. Let me know if further refinement is needed!
