Comprehensive Guidelines for Naming and Defining Business Data Elements (BDEs)

Abstract

Business Data Elements (BDEs) are foundational to effective data governance. A well-defined naming convention ensures consistency, scalability, and clarity, enabling automated processes like tagging, discovery, and lineage tracking. This document introduces detailed guidelines for naming and defining BDEs, incorporating Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property, aligned with standards like FIBO, DCAM, DAMA, and ISO 11179. The guidelines address both simple and complex naming scenarios, ensuring comprehensive coverage for diverse business contexts.

Introduction

Business Data Elements (BDEs) represent critical concepts in an organization’s data ecosystem. These elements must be easily understood and traceable across systems, requiring structured naming conventions and semantic definitions. As organizations deal with increasingly complex data landscapes, naming conventions must adapt to accommodate cross-domain usage, varying lifecycle states, and multi-dimensional contexts.

This document provides a structured approach to naming and defining BDEs, focusing on the following:
	1.	Ensuring clarity and consistency through Title Case with Proper Spacing.
	2.	Capturing complex contexts through structured components: Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property.
	3.	Addressing edge cases and multi-faceted scenarios to ensure scalability.

Core Components of BDE Naming

The naming convention is based on the following structure:
<Data Object> <Scope> <Status> <Property>

1. Data Object

The primary entity or subject the data refers to. This is the core concept in the name.
	•	Examples: Invoice, Customer, Account, Employee, Transaction

2. Scope

Defines the functional, organizational, or geographical boundary for the data.
	•	Examples: Global, Regional, Annual, Monthly, Finance, Sales

3. Status

Describes the state or lifecycle of the data.
	•	Examples: Pending, Approved, Current, Previous, Draft

4. Property

The specific attribute or characteristic being described.
	•	Examples: Amount, Name, Balance, Date, Count

Rules for Naming BDEs
	1.	Title Case with Proper Spacing:
	•	Use Title Case for all words in the name and separate them with spaces.
Example: Invoice Pending Amount
	2.	Be Descriptive and Business-Friendly:
	•	Use clear, concise names that are easy to understand by business and technical users. Avoid technical jargon.
Example: Use Customer Annual Revenue instead of CustAnnRev.
	3.	Avoid Special Characters and Abbreviations:
	•	Do not use underscores (_), hyphens (-), or other special characters. Avoid abbreviations unless universally recognized.
Example: Use Account Balance instead of Acc_Bal.
	4.	No Temporal or Version Indicators in the Name:
	•	Do not include version numbers (v1, 2023) or time-based descriptors (CurrentYear, LastMonth) in the name itself. Use metadata for these.
Example: Use Invoice Amount, not Invoice Amount 2023.
	5.	Consistency Across Domains:
	•	Apply the same naming conventions across all functional areas.
	6.	Align with Organizational Standards:
	•	Ensure that terms align with FIBO, DCAM, or internal glossaries to maintain consistency.

Examples of Simple Scenarios

Finance:
	1.	Name: Invoice Approved Amount
Definition:
	•	Invoice is the monetary amount applicable to approved invoices, used for payment processing.
	2.	Name: Account Current Balance
Definition:
	•	Account is the balance at a given point in time, used for financial reconciliation.

Sales:
	1.	Name: Customer Annual Revenue
Definition:
	•	Customer is the total revenue generated within a calendar year, used for profitability analysis.
	2.	Name: Sales Territory Performance
Definition:
	•	Sales Territory is the performance metric used to evaluate regional sales effectiveness.

Complex Scenarios

Scenario 1: Multi-Dimensional Contexts

When a BDE represents data that varies across multiple dimensions (e.g., geography, time, and currency), the naming convention must reflect all relevant contexts.

Example:
	1.	Name: Customer Regional Annual Revenue USD
Definition:
	•	Customer is the total revenue generated within a calendar year, specific to a region and represented in USD.
	2.	Name: Account Quarterly Balance Approved USD
Definition:
	•	Account is the approved balance at the end of a quarter, represented in USD.

Scenario 2: Hierarchical Relationships

For data that has hierarchical relationships, such as parent-child structures, the naming convention should indicate the relationship explicitly.

Example:
	1.	Name: Parent Account Balance
Definition:
	•	Parent Account is the aggregated balance across all child accounts, used for financial reporting.
	2.	Name: Child Account Current Balance
Definition:
	•	Child Account is the balance specific to a sub-account, used for detailed analysis.

Scenario 3: Cross-Domain Integration

When a BDE is used across multiple domains, the name should clearly indicate the domain and its context.

Example:
	1.	Name: Customer Finance Outstanding Amount
Definition:
	•	Customer is the outstanding amount specific to the Finance domain, used for collections and risk assessment.
	2.	Name: Product Sales Forecast Amount
Definition:
	•	Product is the forecasted sales amount, used for demand planning.

Scenario 4: Event-Based Data

For BDEs tied to specific business events or milestones, the name should include the event context.

Example:
	1.	Name: Transaction Settlement Date
Definition:
	•	Transaction is the date on which the settlement occurred, used for reconciliation.
	2.	Name: Order Dispatch Status
Definition:
	•	Order is the status indicating whether it has been dispatched, used for shipment tracking.

Best Practices for Complex Scenarios
	1.	Maintain Hierarchical Consistency:
	•	Use consistent naming patterns for parent-child relationships and multi-level hierarchies.
Example: Use Parent Account Balance and Child Account Balance, not variations like Parent Bal or Child Acct.
	2.	Clearly Indicate Multi-Dimensional Contexts:
	•	Always specify dimensions such as geography, time, and currency explicitly in the name.
Example: Customer Regional Quarterly Revenue USD
	3.	Adapt to Cross-Domain Needs:
	•	Include the domain context in the name when BDEs span multiple functional areas.
Example: Customer Finance Outstanding Amount
	4.	Leverage Metadata for Additional Attributes:
	•	Avoid cluttering names with excessive context; use metadata to capture supplementary details like timeframes or versions.

Conclusion

By adopting a comprehensive naming convention incorporating Data Object, Scope, Status, and Property, organizations can ensure consistency, clarity, and scalability in their Business Data Elements (BDEs). These conventions provide a foundation for automated governance processes and align with global standards such as FIBO, DCAM, DAMA, and ISO 11179. Addressing both simple and complex scenarios, the guidelines ensure robust data management and usability across all business domains.
