Business Data Element Naming and Description Convention Based on ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023

Abstract

In a data-driven world, the accurate definition, naming, and management of business data elements is essential for ensuring interoperability, data quality, and compliance with regulatory standards. ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023 provides a structured framework for metadata registries, emphasizing consistent data semantics, representation, and usage. This paper outlines naming conventions, quality checks, and guidelines for defining business data elements, along with examples and best practices to implement the standard effectively.

Introduction

Business data elements are the foundation of organizational data management, representing specific data units with precise meanings. Standardized naming, definition, and value domain specifications enhance the clarity, consistency, and interoperability of data across systems and processes.

This paper serves as a guide to implementing ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023 standards, detailing naming conventions, quality assurance processes, and comprehensive examples for defining business data elements and their value domains.

Core Concepts

1. Data Elements

A data element consists of:
	1.	Object Class:
	•	Represents the real-world entity or concept.
	•	Example: customer, product, employee, invoice.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Use singular nouns.
	•	Ensure clarity and avoid ambiguity.
	2.	Property:
	•	Represents a specific characteristic of the object class.
	•	Example: name, price, birth date, payment status.
	•	Best Practices:
	•	Use clear and descriptive terms.
	•	Be specific about the characteristic being described.

Example:
	•	Data Element: customer birth date.
	•	Object Class: customer.
	•	Property: birth date.

2. Value Domains

A value domain defines the permissible values for a data element. It includes:
	1.	Data Type: Specifies the type of data (e.g., text, number, date).
	2.	Format: Defines the structure or pattern of values (e.g., YYYY-MM-DD, decimal 2 places).
	3.	Constraints: Includes business rules or ranges (e.g., “age must be ≥ 18”).
	4.	Units of Measure: Specifies units for numeric data (e.g., USD, kg).

Example:
	•	Data Element: employee birth date.
	•	Value Domain:
	•	Data Type: date.
	•	Format: YYYY-MM-DD.
	•	Constraints: Cannot be a future date; must correspond to age ≥ 18 years.

Naming Convention Structure

1. Data Element Naming Pattern

[Object Class] [Property]

Examples:
	•	customer name.
	•	product unit price.
	•	employee birth date.
	•	invoice payment status.

2. Value Domain Naming Pattern

[Data Type] [Format/Constraints] [Unit/Enumeration]

Examples:
	•	text maximum 50 characters.
	•	number decimal 2 places.
	•	date format YYYY-MM-DD.
	•	code from country list ISO 3166.

Implementation Guidelines for Business Data Element Definitions

1. Structure of Definitions

Each data element definition must include:
	1.	Name: The unique name of the data element.
	2.	Object Class Definition:
	•	Clear description of the entity or concept.
	•	Example: Customer: A person or organization purchasing goods or services.
	3.	Property Definition:
	•	Description of the characteristic being captured.
	•	Example: Name: The legal name of a customer.
	4.	Value Domain Definition:
	•	Data type, format, constraints, and valid values.
	•	Example: Text, maximum 100 characters.

2. Best Practices for Writing Definitions
	•	Use simple and precise language.
	•	Avoid technical jargon unless necessary.
	•	Ensure definitions are business-focused and meaningful to stakeholders.

Example Definition:
	•	Data Element: customer birth date.
	•	Object Class: Customer.
	•	Definition: A person or organization purchasing goods or services.
	•	Property: Birth Date.
	•	Definition: The date of birth of the customer.
	•	Value Domain:
	•	Data Type: Date.
	•	Format: YYYY-MM-DD.
	•	Constraints: Cannot be a future date; must correspond to age ≥ 18 years.

Data Quality Checks

1. Structural Quality Checks

Examples:
	•	Object Class Naming:
	•	Good: customer, savings account.
	•	Poor: cust, accounts.
	•	Property Naming:
	•	Good: legal name, maximum balance.
	•	Poor: cust_name, max bal.

2. Semantic Quality Checks

Examples:
	•	Ensure meaningful names:
	•	Good: loan application status.
	•	Poor: loan stat.
	•	Document business context:
	•	Example:
	•	Purpose: Tracks the approval status of loan applications.
	•	Usage: Used in loan processing workflows.

3. Value Domain Quality Checks

Examples:
	•	Enumerated Values:
	•	Good: Code from payment status list (pending, confirmed, shipped).
	•	Poor: Payment code.
	•	Non-enumerated Values:
	•	Good: Number (decimal, 2 places, USD).
	•	Poor: Amount.

4. Accuracy and Validity Checks

Examples:
	•	Validate numerical ranges:
	•	Product Price: Must be ≥ 0.
	•	Interest Rate: Must be between 0 and 100%.
	•	Temporal rules:
	•	Invoice Date: Cannot be after Payment Date.

5. Completeness Checks

Examples:
	•	Mandatory Fields:
	•	Customer Name: Cannot be null.
	•	Employee ID: Must have a value.
	•	Metadata Completeness:
	•	Verify that all data elements include:
	•	Object Class definition.
	•	Property definition.
	•	Value Domain specification.

6. Integration and Interoperability Checks

Examples:
	•	Cross-System Compatibility:
	•	Ensure the same data element (Customer ID) is used consistently across systems.
	•	Data Exchange Validation:
	•	Verify data conforms to ISO 20022 for financial transactions.

Detailed Examples

Customer Domain
	•	Data Element: customer credit rating.
	•	Object Class: Customer.
	•	Property: Credit Rating.
	•	Value Domain:
	•	Data Type: Code.
	•	Valid Values: AAA, AA, A, BBB, BB, B.

Financial Domain
	•	Data Element: bank account balance.
	•	Object Class: Bank Account.
	•	Property: Balance.
	•	Value Domain:
	•	Data Type: Number.
	•	Format: Decimal (2 places).
	•	Unit: USD.
	•	Constraints: Value ≥ 0.

Conclusion

Adopting ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023 standards for naming and defining business data elements ensures improved data quality, interoperability, and governance. By following structured naming conventions, rigorous quality checks, and clear definition guidelines, organizations can enhance data consistency and support business objectives effectively.

Regular audits, stakeholder collaboration, and updates to metadata registries are essential to maintain compliance and adapt to evolving business needs.
