When the data fabric publishes assets or Data Visa processes privacy requests, these systems query OPA with simple parameters (country + GDC) to receive immediate compliance decisions. While alternatives like AWS Cedar and OpenFGA offer specific advantages, OPA's maturity as a CNCF graduate project and general-purpose design make it optimal for enterprise-wide governance Permit.ioNirmata.
