Cloud Storage:

Role: Cloud Storage serves a dual role as the secure repository for both the raw source documents from the legal team and the final, compiled policy bundles for OPA.

Strategic Importance: This creates a complete, auditable data lifecycle. Storing the initial legal documents (PDFs, DOCX, etc.) provides a version-controlled, immutable record of the source material. Storing the final OPA bundles in a separate bucket provides a reliable and highly available distribution mechanism. This dual role ensures a clear chain of custody from the original legal text to the executable policy being enforced across the enterprise.
