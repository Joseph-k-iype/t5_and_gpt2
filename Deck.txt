## 3. Context & Problem Statement

### Current Compliance Challenges

**Manual Translation Bottleneck**: Legal teams currently translate complex legislation into technical requirements manually, creating delays and inconsistencies across business units.

**Fragmented Rule Systems**: Different data systems implement compliance rules independently, leading to inconsistent interpretations of the same regulations across the enterprise.

**Scalability Constraints**: As the organization expands globally, the manual approach cannot scale to handle the increasing volume and complexity of multi-jurisdictional regulations.

**Integration Complexity**: Downstream systems like enterprise data fabrics and privacy tools require standardized rule formats that current manual processes cannot efficiently provide.

### Strategic Opportunity

The convergence of advanced AI reasoning capabilities and semantic web standards creates an opportunity to automate the legal-to-technical translation process while maintaining human oversight and control. This approach transforms compliance from a reactive, manual process into a proactive, automated capability.
