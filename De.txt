Data Movement & Synchronization

Ensuring the vector store reflects reality.

A common failure mode in RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) applications is "Data Drift," where the vector store returns outdated information that conflicts with the operational database.

The CDC-to-Vector Pipeline

To treat the Vector DB as a reliable "Shadow Store," batch updates are often insufficient. A robust pattern involves Change Data Capture (CDC). By capturing row-level changes from the operational database and pushing them to a streaming platform (like Kafka), the system can trigger an embedding update immediately. This creates a near real-time loop where the semantic search index is always synchronized with the system of record.

Latency Optimization via Semantic Caching

Generating embeddings and querying vector indices are computationally expensive operations. To reduce cost and latency, implement a "Look-Aside" Semantic Cache.
Before hitting the Vector DB, the system should check a high-speed cache (like Redis) for similar previous queries. If a semantic match is found (with a high similarity threshold), the system can return the cached response immediately, bypassing the entire retrieval and generation chain.
