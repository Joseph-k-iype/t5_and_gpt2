In multi-tenant SaaS architectures, the strategy for data isolation dictates both the unit economics and the security posture of the platform. This is not merely a configuration detail but a fundamental architectural decision that impacts how the system scales and how it is priced.

Logical Isolation (Namespacing): The pattern of choice for high-volume, lower-margin tiers (e.g., 'Free Tier'). Here, all tenant data resides in a massive, shared index, virtually separated only by mandatory filter predicates (e.g., tenant_id) attached to every query. While this maximizes resource utilization and minimizes infrastructure costs, it relies entirely on application-layer logic for security. A single bug in the query construction could theoretically expose cross-tenant data, making it less suitable for highly regulated industries.

Physical Isolation (Collections/Shards): A requirement for premium or high-security tenants (e.g., HIPAA, FedRAMP). Allocating separate physical indices or collections allows for distinct encryption keys (Customer Managed Keys - CMK), drastically simplifies data deletion (dropping an index vs. deleting rows), and eliminates the "noisy neighbor" problem where one heavy user degrades performance for others. However, this comes at a significantly higher infrastructure cost and increased operational complexity, often requiring dedicated pods or clusters per tenant.
