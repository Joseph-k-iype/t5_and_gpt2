Privacy & Security Assurance

Protecting data in a probabilistic environment.

Vector databases present unique security challenges because vectors cannot be easily "read" by humans, yet they can be used to reconstruct sensitive information.

The "Embedding Airlock" Principle

You should never embed raw PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Once data is vectorized, it is difficult to selectively redact.
The guidance is to implement an "Airlock" Sanitization Step before the embedding model. Use NLP tools to detect and replace entities (names, SSNs, emails) with generic tokens. This ensures that the vector representation captures the semantic structure of the document without encoding the identity of the subjects.

Filter-First Access Control (RBAC)

Security must be intrinsic to the retrieval process, not an afterthought.
A common anti-pattern is "Post-Filtering," where the database retrieves the top results and then the application filters out unauthorized documents. This leads to unpredictable result counts.
Instead, enforce Filter-First Authorization. The user's access rights (e.g., Group IDs) should be passed as a hard filter into the Vector DB query itself. This ensures the Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search algorithm only considers the subspace of vectors the user is explicitly permitted to see.
