Architectural Attribute
Single-Agent System
Multi-Agent System
Complexity & Cost
Lower complexity, easier to design and debug. Lower computational cost.29
Higher complexity due to coordination protocols. Significantly higher token/compute cost.28
Scalability Model
Scales vertically (make the single agent smarter). Can become a bottleneck.28
Scales horizontally (add more specialized agents). Suited for large, distributed problems.28
Fault Tolerance
Low; represents a single point of failure. If the agent fails, the system stops.28
High; inherently fault-tolerant. If one agent fails, others can continue or take over its tasks.28
Decision-Making
Centralized; all logic and decision-making reside within one agent.28
Decentralized; each agent has a degree of autonomy, enabling collaboration and negotiation.28
Communication
Not applicable; operates in isolation.
Essential; requires communication protocols for coordination, negotiation, and information sharing.28
Ideal Financial Use Case
A focused task like an automated chatbot for FAQs or a tool to classify incoming documents.29
A complex, multi-step workflow like algorithmic trading or end-to-end loan processing involving multiple departments.27
Key Challenge
Limited problem-solving capability for complex, dynamic tasks; lacks redundancy.29
Designing effective coordination and communication mechanisms; managing high computational demand.29
