Retention & Lifecycle Governance

Managing the relevance and legality of stored knowledge.

Vector data is not "write once, read forever." It decays in relevance and must adhere to legal retention schedules.

Handling Model Drift

Embeddings are inextricably linked to the model that created them. If you upgrade your embedding model (e.g., to a newer, multilingual version), all old vectors become incompatible. A Versioned Index Strategy is essential here: maintain the active index while a background worker re-embeds the source data into a new "V2" index. Once complete, perform an atomic swap at the application layer.

Compliance-Driven Partitioning

GDPR and CCPA "Right to be Forgotten" requests can be computationally expensive in a massive vector index. A Time-Based Partitioning strategy—organizing indices by timeframes (e.g., distinct indices for each quarter)—allows for efficient bulk deletion. When a retention period expires, the system can simply drop the entire partition/index rather than performing costly delete operations on millions of individual records.
