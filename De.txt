The Critical Need for an Agentic AI & RAG Architecture Forum
Complexity of Agentic Systems
Agentic AI systems are fundamentally different from traditional software - they're conversational, unpredictable, can fail to give answers or stop answering mid-stream, and require significantly more resources than traditional microservices AI Governance And Enterprise Architecture: Our Perspective. Unlike traditional microservices where authentication involves API keys or certificates, AI agents require sophisticated attestation mechanisms to prove their authenticity and behavioral integrity, with non-deterministic logic that becomes increasingly intelligent and capable of autonomous execution Agentic RAG: What it is, its types, applications and implementation.
Architectural Transformation Requirements
Agentic RAG represents a shift from static rule-based querying to adaptive, intelligent problem-solving, where agents can route to multiple external knowledge sources, break down complex queries into step-by-step processes, and validate/optimize their own results VectorizeAnalytics Vidhya. This requires enterprise-wide coordination as agentic RAG architectures can have various levels of complexity, from simple single-agent routers to sophisticated multi-agent systems with specialized retrieval tools Managing Day 2 Concerns for Agentic AI Architecture - DevOps.com.
Microservices Architecture Benefits for Reusability
Modular Design Patterns
Financial institutions increasingly use microservices architectures and containerization to make AI systems more modular and easier to deploy and scale, allowing for greater flexibility and faster implementation of new AI-driven services The Architecture Repository - Anand Pandey â€“ Architect's Notebook. Decomposing agentic systems into smaller, focused child agents helps avoid pitfalls of monolithic design, where each sub-agent handles specialized domains like returns, orders, or product information AI-Powered Enterprise Architecture: A Strategic Imperative - Architecture & Governance Magazine.
Enterprise Reusability Framework
Agents can employ pre-existing RAG pipelines as tools, function autonomously as RAG tools, or dynamically retrieve relevant tools based on query context, showcasing versatility and adaptability in RAG framework interactions Artificial Intelligence Governance & Alignment with Enterprise Governance - Architecture & Governance Magazine. This modular approach enables workflow automation by streamlining enterprise operations and integrating retrieval-driven decision-making into business processes What is Agentic RAG? How to make AI work smarter, not harder.
Governance and Transparency Imperatives
Enterprise Governance Framework
AI governance requires end-to-end development with standardized AI architecture, tools, and technologies including MLOps tools across the enterprise, focusing on transparency, fairness, security, and accountability 2025: The Future of AI Agents in Enterprise Software Architecture | by Senthil | Medium. Traditional enterprise architecture frameworks are increasingly misaligned with the speed and scale of modern business needs, requiring evolution to dynamic, real-time, and outcome-focused disciplines The Role of AI in Enterprise Architecture: A Future Outlook.
Centralized Oversight Necessity
AI can significantly enhance enterprise architecture reusable knowledge repositories, architecture diagrams, and visualizations by analyzing real-time and historical projects to identify anomalies, bottlenecks, and optimization opportunities Enterprise AI Governance | Datafloq. A coordinated approach ensures model governance provides dashboards, reports, and alerting capabilities to ensure AI models meet requirements for fairness, transparency, and compliance while setting gating criteria for production deployment.
