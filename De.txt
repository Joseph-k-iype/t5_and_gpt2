the enhancement endpoint is not of good quality, it gives the results in this format 1 ** enhanced name and for description it is 2 ** enhanced description. I just need the name and description without any formatting. always it should be a valid json and if there's any json issue, it should clean up and give valid json output. and the logic is a bit flawed it is should be giving the enhanced name and description that is understood by anyone and it should adhere to ISO/IEC 11179:203 standards. you can search the web. keep the instructions to be compliant with the standards in the prompt. the prompt should be well structured such that the enhanced name and description is always of good quality at the same time the response time from the LLM should not be bad, it should be production grade. Write the full and complete code for the updated files in artifacts
