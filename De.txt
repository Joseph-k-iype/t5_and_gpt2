           - Action(s) permitted
           - Target (what the action applies to)
           - Constraints (conditions that must be met)
           - Duties (obligations for exercising the permission)
           - Parties (assigner, assignee)
        
        3. PROHIBITIONS (what is FORBIDDEN):
           - What actions are explicitly prohibited?
           - Under what circumstances are they prohibited?
           - Are there exceptions to the prohibitions?
           - Who sets the prohibition (assigner)?
           - Who is subject to the prohibition (assignee)?
           - What asset/target does the prohibition apply to?
           
           Structure each prohibition with:
           - Action(s) prohibited
           - Target (what the action applies to)
           - Constraints (conditions under which prohibition applies)
           - Parties (assigner, assignee)
        
        4. DUTIES (what MUST be done):
           - What obligations must be fulfilled?
           - Are duties independent or linked to permissions?
           - Who is responsible for the duty (assignee)?
           - What is the consequence of not fulfilling the duty?
           
           Structure each duty with:
           - Action(s) required
           - Target (what the action applies to)
           - Constraints (conditions and timing)
           - Parties (assigner, assignee)
        
        5. CONSTRAINTS (conditions and limitations):
           - Temporal: time-based restrictions
           - Spatial: location/jurisdiction restrictions
           - Purpose: purpose-based restrictions
           - Party: recipient-based restrictions
           - Quantitative: count/amount restrictions
           - Qualitative: quality/type restrictions
           
           For each constraint, identify:
           - leftOperand (what is being constrained)
           - operator (comparison operator)
           - rightOperand (constraint value)
           - description (plain English explanation)
        
        6. ASSETS/TARGETS:
           - What data or resources do the rules apply to?
           - How should they be described in ODRL terms?
        
        7. PARTIES AND ROLES:
           - Assigner: entity that grants permission or sets prohibition
           - Assignee: entity that receives permission or is subject to prohibition
           - Controller: determines purposes and means of processing
           - Processor: processes data on behalf of controller
           - Data Subject: individual whose data is processed
           - Third Party: any other relevant party
           
           Identify specific parties mentioned in guidance or role types.
        
        CRITICAL EXTRACTION REQUIREMENTS:
        - Extract ONLY what is explicitly stated in the guidance text
        - Use ODRL standard terminology precisely
        - Provide specific references to guidance text for each extraction
        - If information is ambiguous, note the ambiguity
        - Focus on creating machine-readable, structured output
        - Maintain clear distinction between permissions and prohibitions
        - Link constraints to the specific rules they affect
        
        Provide detailed extraction with specific text references to support each component.

        ORIGINAL GUIDANCE TEXT (verify against):
        {guidance_text}
        
        DETAILED CONSTRAINT ANALYSIS:
        
        For EACH constraint identified in the ODRL extraction, create a precise,
        machine-readable structure following ODRL 2.2 specification:
        
        1. CONSTRAINT IDENTIFICATION:
           - What is being constrained? (leftOperand)
           - What is the comparison/test? (operator)
           - What is the constraint value? (rightOperand)
           - How does this constraint limit or enable actions?
        
        2. ODRL CONSTRAINT STRUCTURE:
           Each constraint must have:
           - leftOperand: Standard ODRL constraint operand
             (e.g., dateTime, elapsedTime, count, purpose, recipient, spatial, etc.)
           - operator: Standard ODRL operator
             (eq, neq, lt, gt, lteq, gteq, isA, isAnyOf, isNoneOf, isAllOf, isPartOf, hasPart)
           - rightOperand: Value to compare against
             (must match leftOperand type - date, duration, number, URI, etc.)
           - unit: Unit of measurement if applicable (e.g., P30D for 30 days)
           - dataType: Data type of rightOperand (xsd:date, xsd:integer, etc.)
        
        3. CONSTRAINT CLASSIFICATION:
           Identify which rule type each constraint applies to:
           - Permission constraints: Conditions for allowed actions
           - Prohibition constraints: Conditions for forbidden actions
           - Duty constraints: Conditions for required actions
        
        4. OPERATOR VALIDATION:
           Verify operator appropriateness:
           - Equality/Inequality: eq, neq (for exact matches)
           - Comparison: lt, gt, lteq, gteq (for numeric/temporal values)
           - Set operations: isAnyOf, isNoneOf, isAllOf (for lists)
           - Hierarchical: isA, isPartOf, hasPart (for taxonomies)
        
        5. CONSTRAINT DEPENDENCIES:
           - Is the constraint mandatory (MUST) or optional (SHOULD)?
           - What happens if the constraint is violated?
           - Are there any exceptions to the constraint?
        
        6. CONSTRAINT RELATIONSHIPS:
           - Do multiple constraints apply together (AND logic)?
           - Are constraints alternatives (OR logic)?
           - Are there hierarchical constraints (constraint on constraint)?
           - How do constraints interact with each other?
        
        EXAMPLES OF WELL-STRUCTURED CONSTRAINTS:
        
        Example 1: "Data can only be used for educational purposes"

          "scope": "prohibition"
        }}

        CRITICAL LOGICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        1. AVOID DUPLICATION: A constraint should appear in EITHER permissions OR prohibitions, NOT both.
           
           ❌ WRONG:
           Permission:   requestor eq "UK NCA"     (allowed if UK NCA)
           Prohibition:  requestor neq "UK NCA"    (forbidden if not UK NCA)
           → These are logically the SAME rule expressed differently!
           
           ✅ CORRECT:
           Permission:   requestor eq "UK NCA"     (allowed if UK NCA)
           Prohibition:  [empty]
           → Single, clear rule
        
        2. LOGICAL REASONING FRAMEWORK:
           
           When you see: "Data sharing IS PERMITTED if requestor is X"
           → Create: PERMISSION with constraint (leftOperand eq X)
           → Do NOT create: PROHIBITION with constraint (leftOperand neq X)
           
           When you see: "Data sharing IS PROHIBITED if requestor is NOT X"
           → Reframe as: PERMISSION with constraint (leftOperand eq X)
           → This is clearer for enforcement systems
           
           When you see: "Action Y is absolutely PROHIBITED for all cases"
           → Create: PROHIBITION without inverse permission
           → Example: "Data selling is prohibited" → Prohibition only
        
        3. OPERATOR LOGIC:
           - Use "eq" in permissions for positive matching
           - Use "neq" ONLY in prohibitions for exclusions
           - Use "isAnyOf" in permissions for allowed sets
           - Use "isNoneOf" ONLY in prohibitions for forbidden sets

           }}
           → Clear permission with positive constraint

             }}]
           }}
           → DUPLICATION with inverse logic!
           
           Example 3 - Absolute Prohibition (RARE)
           ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
           Guidance: "Sale of personal data is strictly prohibited"
           
           ✅ CORRECT:
           {{
             "permissions": [],
             "prohibitions": [{{
               "action": "sell",

             }}]
           }}

        First, provide your reasoning about permissions vs prohibitions:
        - List all constraints you identified from the guidance
        - For EACH constraint, explain whether it should be in permission or prohibition
        - Explain why no duplications exist in your output
        - Verify operators are correct for the rule type
        
        Then create the complete JSON structure following this format:

        YOUR CRITICAL REVIEW TASK
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        For EACH proposed permission and prohibition, you must:
        
        1. VERIFY AGAINST SOURCE TEXT:
          - Go back to the ORIGINAL GUIDANCE TEXT
          - Find the specific sentence/paragraph that describes this rule
          - Determine: Does the source text say this action IS PERMITTED or IS PROHIBITED?
          
        2. CHECK FOR MISCLASSIFICATION:
          Common misclassification patterns to watch for:
          
          âŒ WRONG: Context says "data sharing is permitted if X" 
                    â†' LLM marked it as PROHIBITION
          
          âœ… CORRECT: Context says "data sharing is permitted if X"
                      â†' Should be marked as PERMISSION with constraint
          
          âŒ WRONG: Context says "processing is allowed for purpose Y"
                    â†' LLM marked it as PROHIBITION  
          
          âœ… CORRECT: Context says "processing is allowed for purpose Y"
                      â†' Should be marked as PERMISSION
          
          âŒ WRONG: Context says "transfer is prohibited to country Z"
                    â†' LLM marked it as PERMISSION
          
          âœ… CORRECT: Context says "transfer is prohibited to country Z"
                      â†' Should be marked as PROHIBITION
        
        3. ANALYZE KEY INDICATOR WORDS:
          
          Permission indicators:
          - "is permitted", "is allowed", "may", "can", "is authorized"
          - "shall be permitted", "organizations may"
          - "is lawful", "is acceptable"
          
          Prohibition indicators:
          - "is prohibited", "is forbidden", "shall not", "must not"
          - "is not permitted", "is not allowed"
          - "is unlawful", "is restricted"
        
        4. CHECK FOR CONTEXT INVERSIONS:
          Sometimes the LLM misunderstands negative phrasing:
          
          "Data may NOT be shared UNLESS adequate protections exist"
          â†' This should be a PERMISSION with constraint (adequate protections)
          â†' NOT a prohibition
          
          "Processing is NOT allowed EXCEPT for legitimate interests"
          â†' This should be a PERMISSION with constraint (legitimate interests)
          â†' NOT a prohibition
        
        5. REVIEW CONSTRAINT OPERATORS:
          - Permissions typically use: eq, isAnyOf, gt, lt (positive matching)
          - Prohibitions typically use: neq, isNoneOf (negative matching)
          - If a "prohibition" uses positive operators (eq), it's likely misclassified

        CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
        ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
        
        - ALWAYS quote exact text from the source guidance to support your decisions
        - If unsure, mark confidence as low and explain why
        - When you find misclassifications, ALWAYS provide the corrected lists
        - Focus on the LEGISLATIVE INTENT in the original text
        - Err on the side of caution: if ambiguous, request clarification
        - Your review is the final check before policies are enforced
        
        Remember: A misclassified permission/prohibition can lead to:
        - Data being blocked when it should be allowed (false negative)
        - Data being allowed when it should be blocked (false positive - DANGEROUS)
        
        Your careful review prevents these critical errors."""
