# Email Template: ODRL Policy Review for Stakeholders

-----

**Subject:** ACTION REQUIRED: Review Data Privacy Policies - [Legislation Name] Compliance

-----

Dear [Stakeholder Name/Team],

I hope this email finds you well. As part of our ongoing compliance initiative for **[GDPR/CCPA/HIPAA/etc.]**, we’ve completed the technical translation of our legal requirements into machine-readable policies.

**We need your expertise to verify that these policies accurately reflect our business requirements and legal obligations.**

## 📎 What’s Attached

You’ll find an Excel file attached: **`[Legislation]_Policy_Review_[Date].xlsx`**

This file contains all data processing rules extracted from [legislation/legal documents], organized in a format that’s easy to review and validate.

## 📊 Understanding the Excel File

The workbook contains **5 worksheets**, each serving a specific purpose:

### **Sheet 1: Summary** ⭐ *Start Here*

- Quick overview of all policies
- Total counts of permissions and prohibitions
- Most common actions
- Framework breakdown

**What to look for:** Do the numbers make sense? Are all expected frameworks present?

-----

### **Sheet 2: Policy Overview** 📋

Contains high-level information about each policy:

- **Policy ID**: Unique identifier for tracking
- **Title**: Human-readable policy name
- **Description**: What the policy covers
- **Framework**: The legislation it comes from (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- **Data Categories**: Types of data covered (Personal Data, Financial Info, etc.)
- **Geographic Coverage**: Where the policy applies (EU, US, etc.)
- **Confidence Score**: Our confidence level in the extraction accuracy

**What to review:**

- ✓ Are the policy titles clear and accurate?
- ✓ Do the data categories match what you expect?
- ✓ Is the geographic coverage correct?

-----

### **Sheet 3: Permissions** ✅ *Critical Review*

This is where you’ll spend most of your time. Each row represents something we’re **allowed to do** with data.

**Key Columns:**

- **What is Allowed**: The action (Use, Distribute, Transfer, etc.)
- **Applies To (Target)**: What data/asset this applies to
- **Who Grants This**: The entity granting permission
- **Who Can Do This**: Who can perform the action
- **Conditions/Constraints**: Under what circumstances (VERY IMPORTANT)
- **Required Duties**: Obligations that must be fulfilled first
- **Details/Notes**: Additional context

**What to review:**

1. ✓ Is each permission actually allowed under the legislation?
1. ✓ Are the conditions/constraints accurate and complete?
1. ✓ Are any permissions missing?
1. ✓ Are any permissions too broad or too restrictive?
1. ✓ Do the required duties make sense?

**Example Row:**

```
What is Allowed: Use
Applies To: Personal Data
Who Can Do This: Marketing Department
Conditions: purpose = Marketing; consent = obtained
Required Duties: Obtain Consent
```

**Questions to ask:**

- Can marketing really use personal data this way?
- Are there other conditions we should add?
- Is “obtain consent” sufficient, or do we need explicit consent?

-----

### **Sheet 4: Prohibitions** 🚫 *Critical Review*

Each row represents something that is **forbidden**.

**Key Columns:**

- **What is Forbidden**: The prohibited action
- **Applies To (Target)**: What data/asset
- **Who is Restricted**: Who cannot do this
- **When/Where Forbidden**: Specific conditions
- **Details/Notes**: Additional context

**What to review:**

1. ✓ Are all necessary prohibitions present?
1. ✓ Are any prohibitions incorrect or too strict?
1. ✓ Do the conditions properly restrict the prohibition?

**Example Row:**

```
What is Forbidden: Sell
Applies To: Personal Data
When/Where Forbidden: Always
Details: Selling personal data is absolutely prohibited under GDPR
```

**Questions to ask:**

- Is this prohibition absolute or conditional?
- Are there any exceptions we’re missing?
- Does this align with our business practices?

-----

### **Sheet 5: Obligations** ⚖️

Required duties and mandatory actions (if present in the policies).

**What to review:**

- ✓ Are all obligations technically feasible?
- ✓ Are timeframes realistic?
- ✓ Do we have processes in place to fulfill these?

-----

## 🔍 How to Review: Step-by-Step Process

### **Step 1: Quick Scan (15 minutes)**

1. Open the **Summary** sheet
1. Review the totals - do they seem reasonable?
1. Check the **Policy Overview** sheet
1. Verify framework names and data categories

### **Step 2: Deep Review (1-2 hours)**

1. Go to the **Permissions** sheet
1. **Enable filters** (if not already on): Click any header → Filter button
1. Sort by “What is Allowed” to group similar actions
1. For each permission:
- Read the action and target
- **Carefully review the conditions** - these are crucial!
- Verify the required duties
- Check if it matches your understanding of the legislation
1. Go to the **Prohibitions** sheet
1. Review each prohibition similarly
1. Look for:
- Missing prohibitions
- Overly broad prohibitions
- Conflicts with permissions

### **Step 3: Cross-Check (30 minutes)**

1. Compare **Permissions** and **Prohibitions** for logical conflicts
1. Example conflict: “Permission to transfer data to EU” vs “Prohibition on transferring data”
1. Verify that conditions don’t contradict each other

### **Step 4: Document Feedback (As needed)**

-----

### **Option B: Tracked Changes**

1. Enable Track Changes: Review → Track Changes
1. Make edits directly in cells
1. All changes will be highlighted

## ⚠️ What to Look For: Common Issues

### 🔴 **Red Flags - Report Immediately:**

1. **Missing consent requirements** where legally required
1. **Conflicts between permissions and prohibitions**
1. **Incorrect geographic scope** (e.g., applies globally when should be EU-only)

### 🟡 **Yellow Flags - Discuss:**

1. Ambiguous conditions (e.g., “reasonable purpose”)
1. Missing specific data categories
1. Unclear duty requirements
1. Conditions that may be hard to enforce technically

### 🟢 **Green Flags - These Are Good:**

1. Specific, measurable conditions
1. Clear purpose limitations

1. Realistic geographic constraints
