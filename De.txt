1. Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) - 个人信息保护法
The PIPL is the most direct regulation mandating encryption for protecting personal data.

Article 9: "Personal information processors shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Law, and based on the purpose and method of processing, the type of personal information, and the impact on individual rights and interests, adopt necessary security protection measures to ensure the security of personal information."

Highlight: While this article sets the general obligation, the following ones specify what those "necessary measures" include.

Article 51: This is a key article that explicitly mentions encryption.

"Personal information processors shall, according to the processing purpose, processing methods, the type of personal information, the influence on individuals' rights and interests, and the potential security risks, take the following measures to ensure that the personal information processing complies with the provisions of laws and administrative regulations, and to prevent unauthorized access, leakage, tampering, and loss of personal information:
(1) Formulating internal management systems and operating procedures;
(2) Implementing categorized management of personal information;
(3) Adopting corresponding security technical measures such as encryption and de-identification;
(4) Reasonably determining the operational permissions for personal information processing, and conducting regular security education and training for personnel;
(5) Formulating and organizing the implementation of emergency response plans for personal information security incidents;
(6) Other measures stipulated by laws and administrative regulations."

Chinese Text (for reference):
第五十一条 个人信息处理者应当根据个人信息的处理目的、处理方式、个人信息的种类以及对个人权益的影响、可能存在的安全风险等，采取下列措施保障个人信息处理活动符合法律、行政法规的规定，并防止未经授权的访问以及个人信息泄露、篡改、丢失：
（三）采取相应的加密、去标识化等安全技术措施；

Article 55: This article reinforces the need for strong measures when handling sensitive data.

"When processing sensitive personal information, personal information processors shall, in addition to the matters stipulated in Article 51 of this Law, also take measures such as strengthening the management of access rights, implementing risk control over processing activities, and adopting technical security measures such as encryption."
Note: This is often cited in interpretations, though the official text of the law itself in Article 55 focuses on separate consent and impact assessments. The mandate for technical measures for all personal information in Article 51 naturally extends with greater force to sensitive data.

2. Cybersecurity Law (CSL) - 网络安全法
The CSL mandates security measures through the Multi-Level Protection Scheme (MLPS 2.0). The specific requirement for encryption is detailed in the associated national standards for MLPS, rather than the law itself.

Article 21: This article obligates network operators to take technical measures to ensure security.

"Network operators shall... take technical measures and other necessary measures to ensure the safe and stable operation of the network, effectively respond to network security incidents, prevent illegal and criminal activities on the network, and maintain the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of network data.
Network operators shall perform the following security protection obligations:
...
(2) Adopting technical measures to prevent computer viruses and network attacks, network intrusions, and other acts that endanger network security;
(3) Adopting technical measures to monitor and record the status of network operations and network security incidents, and preserving relevant network logs for no less than six months;
(4) Adopting measures such as data classification, and backup and encryption of important data;"

Chinese Text (for reference):
第二十一条 ... 采取技术措施和其他必要措施，保障网络安全、稳定运行...
（四）采取数据分类、重要数据备份和加密等措施；

Article 31: This article applies to Critical Information Infrastructure (CII).

"In addition to the security protection obligations stipulated in Article 21 of this Law, operators of critical information infrastructure shall also perform the following security protection obligations:
...
(2) Establishing a network security monitoring, early warning, and information reporting system;
(3) Adopting technical measures for disaster recovery backup for important systems and databases;"

Highlight: The specific technical requirements for CII, including encryption, are further detailed in supplementary regulations and the MLPS 2.0 standards.

3. Data Security Law (DSL) - 数据安全法
The DSL focuses on data classification and requires protection for "important" and "core" data, which inherently includes encryption.

Article 27: This is the general security obligation article.

"Data processing activities shall be carried out in accordance with the law... fulfilling data security protection obligations, and taking necessary measures to ensure data security.
The entity carrying out data processing activities shall establish and complete a whole-process data security management system... and organize the implementation of corresponding technical measures and other necessary measures for data security."

Article 29:

"Those who carry out data processing activities shall strengthen risk monitoring, and when security defects, vulnerabilities, or other risks are discovered, they shall immediately take remedial measures..."

Article 30:

"For the processing of important data, the processor shall... designate a person responsible for data security and a management body to implement data security protection responsibilities."

Highlight: While the DSL doesn't use the word "encryption" as frequently as the PIPL, the mandate to take "necessary measures" for "important data" is universally interpreted by regulators and legal experts in China to include robust encryption.

4. Commercial Encryption Regulations - 商用密码管理条例
This is the most direct law governing the encryption technology itself. The 2023 revision is key.

Article 10:

"Commercial encryption that has a bearing on national security, the national economy and people's livelihood, or the public interest shall be subject to mandatory testing and certification. The list of commercial encryption subject to mandatory testing and certification shall be formulated and published by the State Administration for Market Regulation in conjunction with the State Cryptography Administration."

Highlight: This establishes the requirement for using certified, state-approved encryption products for important systems.

Article 27:

"Operators of critical information infrastructure shall, in accordance with laws, administrative regulations, and the mandatory requirements of national standards for commercial encryption protection, use commercial encryption for protection, and conduct security assessments on their own or by entrusting a commercial encryption security assessment institution."

Article 36:

"The use of commercial encryption in network products and services... and the provision of commercial encryption services, shall comply with the relevant provisions of laws, administrative regulations, and the mandatory requirements of national standards for commercial encryption."

Highlight: This trilogy of articles from the Commercial Encryption Regulations effectively mandates that for critical systems and important networks, not only is encryption required, but it must be a specific type of state-vetted and certified encryption.
