- 22% below the general Bangalore market average (₹18 LPA)
- 42% below the Data Architect banking average (₹24 LPA)

- High-value specialized domain knowledge

### 4. **Alignment with Market Standards**

At ₹23 LPA, my compensation would be:

- Aligned with HSBC’s average for experienced Data Scientists (₹23.87 LPA)
- Within the 75th percentile for Bangalore Data Scientists (₹27.6 LPA)
- Fair compensation for combined DS + Architect responsibilities
- Below the banking Data Architect average (₹27 LPA), despite performing this role

## Proposed Compensation: ₹23 LPA

### Breakdown of Request:

- **Current CTC:** ₹14 LPA
- **Proposed CTC:** ₹23 LPA
