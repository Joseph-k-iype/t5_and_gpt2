Detailed Naming Convention Structure

A robust naming convention ensures data elements are named consistently, clearly, and meaningfully across the organization. This consistency helps in identifying, understanding, and using data correctly across systems and teams. Below is a detailed breakdown of the naming convention structure based on ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023.

1. General Structure

The naming convention for a data element typically follows this format:

[Object Class] [Property]

Object Class:
	•	Describes the real-world entity or concept that the data represents.
	•	Should always be a singular noun or noun phrase.
	•	Examples:
	•	customer
	•	product
	•	invoice
	•	employee

Property:
	•	Describes the specific characteristic or attribute of the object class.
	•	Should always be a descriptive noun phrase.
	•	Examples:
	•	name
	•	birth date
	•	status
	•	unit price

2. Value Domain Naming Structure

For value domains, the naming convention follows this format:

[Data Type] [Format/Constraints] [Unit/Enumeration]

Data Type:
	•	Specifies the type of data (e.g., text, number, date).
	•	Examples:
	•	text
	•	number
	•	date

Format/Constraints:
	•	Defines the structure, precision, or permissible values of the data.
	•	Examples:
	•	maximum 50 characters (for text).
	•	decimal 2 places (for numbers).
	•	YYYY-MM-DD (for dates).

Unit/Enumeration:
	•	Indicates the unit of measure (e.g., currency, weight) or list of valid values.
	•	Examples:
	•	USD (for monetary values).
	•	kg (for weight).
	•	code from ISO 3166 country list.

3. Detailed Naming Rules

Object Class Naming Rules
	•	Use singular nouns to represent entities.
	•	Good: employee, customer.
	•	Poor: employees, customers.
	•	Be specific and unambiguous.
	•	Good: bank account.
	•	Poor: account.
	•	Avoid abbreviations unless industry-standard.
	•	Good: savings account.
	•	Poor: sav acc.

Property Naming Rules
	•	Use clear, descriptive terms to define characteristics.
	•	Good: legal name.
	•	Poor: name.
	•	Avoid technical jargon or abbreviations.
	•	Good: registration date.
	•	Poor: reg date.
	•	Ensure the property is specific to the object class.
	•	Good: customer birth date.
	•	Poor: birth date (not clear who it belongs to).

Value Domain Naming Rules
	•	Clearly specify data type and format.
	•	Good: text maximum 50 characters.
	•	Poor: string.
	•	Include units of measure for numeric values.
	•	Good: number decimal 2 places in USD.
	•	Poor: money.
	•	Enumerate values explicitly for code lists.
	•	Good: code from payment method list (credit card, cash, check).
	•	Poor: payment type.

4. Examples of Naming Conventions

Customer Domain
	1.	Data Element: customer legal name
	•	Object Class: customer
	•	Property: legal name
	•	Value Domain: text maximum 100 characters
	2.	Data Element: customer registration date
	•	Object Class: customer
	•	Property: registration date
	•	Value Domain: date format YYYY-MM-DD
	3.	Data Element: customer credit rating
	•	Object Class: customer
	•	Property: credit rating
	•	Value Domain: code from credit rating list (AAA, AA, A, BBB)

Financial Domain
	1.	Data Element: bank account balance
	•	Object Class: bank account
	•	Property: balance
	•	Value Domain: number decimal 2 places in USD
	2.	Data Element: bank account type
	•	Object Class: bank account
	•	Property: type
	•	Value Domain: code from account type list (savings, current, fixed deposit)

Product Domain
	1.	Data Element: product unit price
	•	Object Class: product
	•	Property: unit price
	•	Value Domain: number decimal 2 places in USD
	2.	Data Element: product description
	•	Object Class: product
	•	Property: description
	•	Value Domain: text maximum 500 characters
	3.	Data Element: product category
	•	Object Class: product
	•	Property: category
	•	Value Domain: code from product category list (electronics, clothing, furniture)

5. Benefits of Adopting the Naming Convention
	1.	Clarity:
	•	Clear, descriptive names make it easier for business users to understand the purpose of each data element.
	2.	Consistency:
	•	Uniform patterns across all data elements reduce confusion and promote standardization.
	3.	Interoperability:
	•	Following international standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023) facilitates seamless data exchange across systems.
	4.	Governance:
	•	Proper naming conventions improve metadata management and compliance with data governance policies.

This detailed naming convention structure ensures all data elements are consistently named, defined, and used across systems, enabling better communication, governance, and data quality in line with ISO/IEC 11179-1:2023 standards.
